#create a new branch
git checkout -b <branchname>

#switch branches
git checkout <branchname>

#List all the branches in your repo, and also tell you what branch you're currently in:
git branch

#delete branch
git branch -d <branchname>

#push to branch
git push origin <branchname>


#Push all branches to your remote repository:
git push --all origin

#Fetch and merge changes on the remote server to your working directory:
git pull

#f you mess up, you can replace the changes in your working tree with the last content in head:
Changes already added to the index, as well as new files, will be kept.
git checkout -- <filename>

#Instead, to drop all your local changes and commits,
fetch the latest history from the server and point your local master branch at it, do this:
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/master
